 Rail lines built in 1854 connected Ottawa to areas south and, from 1886, to the transcontinental rail network via Hull and Lachute, Quebec

Ottawa has the most educated population among Canadian cities and is home to a number of colleges and universities, research and cultural institutions, including the University of Ottawa, Carleton University, Algonquin College, the National Arts Centre, the National Gallery of Canada; and numerous national museums, monuments, and historic sites

Prehistory
Rock art engravings found in Goa are one of the earliest known traces of human life in India
Goa ( (listen)) is a state on the southwestern coast of India within the Konkan region, geographically separated from the Deccan highlands by the Western Ghats
 The historic city of Margão in Goa still exhibits the cultural influence of the Portuguese, who first voyaged to the subcontinent in the early 16th century as merchants, and conquered it soon thereafter, whereupon Goa became an overseas territory of the Portuguese Empire, part of what was then known as Portuguese India, and remained as such for about 456 years until it was annexed by India in 1961
 Over the next few centuries, Goa was successively ruled by the Kadambas as the feudatories of the Chalukyas of Kalyani
 In ancient literature, Goa was known by many names, such as Gomanchala, Gopakapattana, Gopakapattam, Gopakapuri, Govapuri, Govem, and Gomantak
 Goa's official language, which is spoken by a majority of its inhabitants, is Konkani
 By the mid-18th century, Portuguese expansions lost other possessions in India until their borders stabilised and formed the Goa, Daman and Diu, which included Silvassa prior to the Annexation, it was known as Estado da Índia in Portuguese, that is the "State of Portuguese India"
 From 765 to 1015, the Southern Silharas of Konkan ruled Goa as the feudatories of the Chalukyas and the Rashtrakutas
From the latter decades of the eighteenth century, the territory of Goa was composed of two segments: the central nucleus of the Velhas Conquistas (Old Conquests)—Bardes, Ilhas de Goa, and Salcette—which territories had been under Portuguese administration since the sixteenth century; and the Novas Conquistas (New Conquests)—Bicholim, Canacona, Pernem, Quepem, Sattari, and Sanguem—territories which had been successively added through the eighteenth century

Indigenous peoples
Indigenous Australians comprise two groups - the Aboriginal peoples of the Australian mainland (and surrounding islands including Tasmania), and the Torres Strait Islanders, who are a distinct Melanesian people
The majority of European Australians are of British Isles – English, Irish, Scottish, or Welsh – ancestral origin
 Australia's demography has been shaped by centuries of immigration: immigrants account for 30% of the country's population, and almost half of Australians have at least one parent born overseas
 Historically, European immigrants had great influence over Australian culture and society, which resulted in the perception of Australia as a European-derived country
 A smaller proportion of Australians are descended from Australia's indigenous peoples, comprising Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders
 Australian law does not provide for a racial or ethnic component of nationality, instead relying on citizenship as a legal status

The founding of the Casa de Moneda de Manila mint in 1857 and the minting of gold 1, 2 and 4 peso coins starting 1861, and
The minting of 50, 20 and 10 centimo silver coins starting 1864
 Faced with this threat to her silver exports, Mexico returned to the old eight-real peso by decree of May 29, 1873, but international trade was already shifting from silver to gold, and after 1873 there was a steady decline in the international price of silver
 In most countries the peso uses the same sign, "$", as many currencies named "dollar"
The peso is the monetary unit of several countries in the Americas, and the Philippines
057 g) based on the average silver content of worn peso coins


Origin and history
1537–1686 piece of eight
The name peso was given to the 8-real silver coin introduced in 1497, minted at 83⁄8 pesos to a Castilian mark (230
 Chinese merchants rejected the new coin, discounting it by 4%–5% in favor of the old eight-real peso
"The Spanish dollar continued to dominate the Eastern trade, and the peso of eight reales continued to be minted in the New World
80, known as the peso maria or peso sencillo) which was poorly received by the people

In 1869–1870, not long after adopting the metric system, Mexican mints began producing the peso of “Un Peso” denomination, popularly known as “balanza” (scales), with the same weight and fineness, but with a uniform diameter of 37 mm (making it slightly thicker than the old peso, which was slightly irregular, with a diameter of 38–40 mm)


Countries that use pesos
Current
Former
Several countries formerly used different currencies also named peso not listed here, with different value, over time


Prior to 1852 the Philippines had no currency of its own (with the exception of local copper cuartos) since pesos received from Spain and Spanish Latin America were accepted in circulation


In Spain
While the relationship of 8 reales = $1 (or peso duro) continued in the Americas until the 19th century, Spain grappled with the issuance of reales de vellon (made of billon alloy with less than ½ silver) of various weights and finenesses starting in 1600 due to its domestic financial and monetary problems

A final alteration in 1772 further reduced the fineness of the peso from 11/12 fine to 130/144 = 0


Philippine peso
The Philippine peso (Filipino: piso) is derived from the Spanish silver coin Real de a Ocho or Spanish dollar, in wide circulation in the entire America and Southeast Asia during the 17th and 18th centuries, through its use in the Spanish colonies and even in the United States and Canada
 The situation was only resolved in 1837 with the peso duro fixed at $1 = 20 reales de vellon, with all prior non-standard reales demonetized
 This new peso became even more popular in international trade, with recipients finding it more advantageous to trade it as coined silver of known value rather than melting it into silver bullion
 The peso and the real were only fully retired with the introduction in 1868 of the Spanish peseta, at par with the French franc, and at the rate of $1 = 20 reales = 5 pesetas = 22
 Thus, following the great silver devaluation of 1873, the Philippine peso devalued in parallel with the Mexican unit, and by the end of the 19th century, was worth half a United States dollar

Spanish laws of 1728 and 1730 ordered the mechanization of the minting of the peso so that they would be perfectly round and have milled edges

The silver peso worth eight reales was also known in English as a Spanish dollar or "piece of eight" and was a widely used international trade coin from the 16th to the 19th century
 The coin was sometimes called a Republican dollar, but eventually any peso of the old Spanish eight-real standard was generally referred to as a Mexican dollar, Mexico being the most prolific producer
 See Argentine peso#History
 Mexico minted the last eight-real peso in 1897, and at the beginning of the twentieth century these Mexican dollar coins were worth only 50 U

Initially the peso was produced in Spanish Latin America in a rapid and simplified manner by cutting off a lump of silver of proper weight and fineness from the end of a silver bar, which was then flattened out and impressed by a hammer
5 pesos to a mark (27
An edict made in the same year which valued the peso duro at $1 = 15+2⁄34 reales de vellon proved to be ineffective as the various reales in circulation contained even less silver
 Originating in the Spanish Empire, the word peso translates to "weight"

 From the mid-14th to the mid-15th century, France was plunged into a series of dynastic conflicts involving England, collectively known as the Hundred Years' War, and a distinct French identity emerged as a result
 Modern France is still named today Francia in Italian and Spanish, while Frankreich in German, Frankrijk in Dutch and Frankrike in Swedish all mean "Land/realm of the Franks"
 The borders of modern France roughly correspond to ancient Gaul, which was inhabited by Celtic Gauls
 France is a founding and leading member of the European Union and the Eurozone, as well as a key member of the Group of Seven, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and Francophonie
 France again emerged as Europe's dominant power in the 17th century under Louis XIV following the Thirty Years' War
 The collapse of the empire initiated a period of relative decline, in which France endured a tumultuous succession of governments until the founding of the French Third Republic during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870

Inhabited since the Palaeolithic era, the territory of Metropolitan France was settled by Celtic tribes known as Gauls during the Iron Age

The Indian rupee was the official currency of Dubai and Qatar until 1959, when India created a new Gulf rupee (also known as the "external rupee") to hinder the smuggling of gold


East Africa, Arabia, and Mesopotamia
In East Africa, Arabia, and Mesopotamia, the rupee and its subsidiary coinage was current at various times
 Other coins for half anna (adhanni, or two paisas), two annas (duanni), four annas (a chawanni, or a quarter of a rupee), and eight annas (an athanni, or half a rupee) were widely in use until decimalization in 1961
Rupee is the common name for the currencies of 
India,  Mauritius, Nepal, Pakistan, Seychelles, and Sri Lanka, and of former currencies of Afghanistan, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, the United Arab Emirates (as the Gulf rupee), British East Africa, Burma, German East Africa (as Rupie/Rupien), and Tibet

The Indian rupees (₹) and Pakistani rupees (Rs


History
The history of the rupee traces back to Ancient India circa 3rd century BC
 Stainless steel coinage of 10, 25 and 50 paise, was introduced in 1988 and of one rupee in 1992
 Acute shortage of silver during the First World War, led to the introduction of paper currency of One Rupee and Two and a half Rupees
 The Mauritian, Seychellois, and Sri Lankan rupees subdivide into 100 cents


Denominations
The original silver rupee, 
 These attempts were resisted by the locals, and by 1867 when the British government took over direct control of the Straits Settlements from the East India Company, attempts to introduce the rupee were finally abandoned
 The Nepalese rupee (रू) subdivides into one hundred paisa (singular and plural) or four sukaas

 The use of the rupee coin continued under the Mughal Empire with the same standard and weight, though some rulers after Mughal Emperor Akbar occasionally issued heavier rupees

The rise in the price of silver immediately after the First World War caused the rupee to rise in value to two shillings sterling
 In Mozambique, the British India rupees were overstamped, and in Kenya, the British East Africa Company minted the rupee and its fractions, as well as pice
 Each circulating coin of British India, until the rupee was decimalised, had a different name in practice
 A corn sheaf replaced the Tiger on the one Rupee coin
 The East India Company tried to introduce the rupee in its place
 The monetary system was retained with one Rupee consisting of 16 Annas
 The rupee was now divided into 100 'Paisa' instead of 16 Annas or 64 Pice
 The compulsion of the Second World War led to experiments in coinage where the standard rupee was replaced by the "Quaternary Silver Alloy"
 The Monetary System remained unchanged at One Rupee consisting of 64 pice, or 192 pies

The most commonly used symbol for the rupee is "₨"


Tibet
Until the middle of the 20th century, Tibet's official currency was also known as the Tibetan rupee
 In Indonesia and the Maldives, the unit of currency is known as rupiah and rufiyaa respectively, cognates of the word rupee

The 1911 accession to the throne of the King-Emperor George V led to the famous "pig rupee"

 By the mid-19th century, the RIAL had lost control of the other eighty-two grammar schools it had administered
 After leaving Formula One at the end of the 1989 season, the Rial Racing division was closed, and the company did not race again

At Rial's début race, the 1988 Brazilian Grand Prix, de Cesaris qualified 14th and reached sixth place in the race, but he ran out of fuel seven laps from the end
 Mechanical failures occurred during the following races, and Rial twice breached regulations; for working on the car on-track and the drivers head being above the roll bar - necessitating a modification of the car
 Since the revised Royal Charter of 1852, The trustees of the RIAL are the board of governors of McGill University
 Percival Molson Memorial Stadium at McGill is named in his honour
  Thus, the "Rial's" were people who always worked in or were associated with rias
  The RIAL was initially authorized to operate two new Royal Grammar Schools, in Quebec City and in Montreal


Racing history

 Dedicated on October 6, 1946, the Memorial Hall and adjoining Memorial Pool honour students who had enlisted and died in the First World War, and in the Second World War
 The RIAL continues to exist today; it is the corporate identity that runs the university and its various constituent bodies, including the former Macdonald College (now Macdonald Campus), the Montreal Neurological Institute, and the Royal Victoria College (the former women's college turned residence)
 Schmid followed the same strategy as he had at ATS, advertising the Rial wheel brand by entering Formula One as a constructor
  From ancient times, the people who worked or went to sea from these rias were called "the people of the ria" or "the ria people", and eventually those people were designated by the single word "rial" which evolved into the permanent family surname of Rial

Strong speculation indicates that the surname Rial as described here had its origin in the Celtic region of the Iberian Peninsula during the Roman occupation of Spain which occurred from about 140 BCE until about 400 CE
 The surname "Rial" is a very old family name and people with that last name can be found in small numbers in several countries of the western world that use the English language (e

History
Ancient antiquity
Since approximately 10,000 BC, Syria was one of the centers of Neolithic culture (known as Pre-Pottery Neolithic A), where agriculture and cattle breeding first began to appear
 Syria was under Emergency Law from 1963 to 2011, effectively suspending the constitutional protections for citizens


Etymology
Several sources indicate that the name Syria is derived from the 8th century BC Luwian term "Sura/i", and the derivative ancient Greek name: Σύριοι, Sýrioi, or Σύροι, Sýroi, both of which originally derived from Aššūrāyu (Assyria) in northern Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq)
 However, from the Seleucid Empire (323–150 BC), this term was also applied to The Levant, and from this point the Greeks applied the term without distinction between the Assyrians of Mesopotamia and Arameans of the Levant
 Archaeologists have demonstrated that civilization in Syria was one of the most ancient on earth, perhaps preceded by only that of Mesopotamia

of or pertaining to or characteristic of Italy or its people or culture or language
 After centuries of political and territorial divisions, Italy was almost entirely unified in 1861 following a war of independence, establishing the Kingdom of Italy
a native or inhabitant of Italy
a native or resident of Florence, Italy
 From the late 19th century to the early 20th century, Italy rapidly industrialised, mainly in the north, and acquired a colonial empire, while the south remained largely impoverished and excluded from industrialisation, fuelling a large and influential diaspora
During the Early Middle Ages, Italy endured the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the Barbarian Invasions, but by the 11th century, numerous city-states and maritime republics, mostly in the North, became prosperous through trade, commerce, and banking, laying the groundwork for modern capitalism
The borders of Roman Italy, Italia, are better established
 However, centuries of rivalry and infighting between the Italian city-states, and the invasions of other European powers during the Italian Wars of the 15th and 16th centuries, left Italy politically fragmented
 Nevertheless, by his time the larger concept of Oenotria and "Italy" had become synonymous, and the name also applied to most of Lucania as well
 Cato's Origines, the first work of history composed in Latin, described Italy as the entire peninsula south of the Alps
 In 264 BC, Roman Italy extended from the Arno and Rubicon rivers of the centre-north to the entire south

Italy shares land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia and the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino
Italy is a highly developed country, having the tenth-largest nominal GDP (third in the European Union) in the world, the ninth-largest national wealth and the third-largest central bank gold reserve
According to Antiochus of Syracuse, the term Italy was used by the ancient Greeks to initially refer only to the southern portion of the Bruttium peninsula corresponding to the modern province of Reggio and part of the provinces of Catanzaro and Vibo Valentia in southern Italy
 Italy covers an area of 301,230 km2 (116,310 sq mi), with a population of about 60 million
 Italy is a founding and leading member of the European Union and a member of numerous international institutions, including the United Nations, NATO, the OECD, the G7, the Latin Union, the Schengen Area, and many more
the Romance language spoken in Italy
 By the first century BC, the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural, political and religious centre, inaugurating the Pax Romana, a period of more than 200 years during which Italy's law, technology, economy, art, and literature developed
 The participation of Italy in World War II on the Axis led to the Italian surrender to Allied powers and its occupation by Nazi Germany helped by Fascists, followed by the rise of the Italian Resistance and the subsequent Italian Civil War and liberation of Italy
 Ancient Greek historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus states this account together with the legend that Italy was named after Italus, mentioned also by Aristotle and Thucydides
 Italy's capital and largest city is Rome
 The Latins, native of central Italy, formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC, which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People
Italy (Italian: Italia [iˈtaːlja] (listen)), officially the Italian Republic or the Republic of Italy, is a country in Southern and Western Europe
 The ancient Greeks gradually came to apply the name "Italia" to a larger region In addition to the "Greek Italy" in the south, historians have suggested the existence of an "Etruscan Italy" covering variable areas of central Italy
 Italy's commercial and political power significantly waned during the 17th and 18th centuries with the decline of the Catholic Church and the increasing importance of trade routes that bypassed the Mediterranean

Italy was the native place of many civilizations such as the Italic peoples and the Etruscans, while due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean, the country has also historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures, who immigrated to the peninsula throughout history
 The Renaissance began in Italy and spread to the rest of Europe, bringing a renewed interest in humanism, science, exploration, and art
 According to Cato and several Roman authors, the Alps formed the "walls of Italy"
, Literary Arabic: Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) or Classical Arabic—and diverse vernacular varieties, which serve as mother tongues
a member of a Semitic people originally from the Arabian peninsula and surrounding territories who speaks Arabic and who inhabits much of the Middle East and northern Africa
 Combined, Arabic dialects have 362 million native speakers, while MSA is spoken by 274 million L2 speakers, making it the sixth most spoken language in the world


History
Old Arabic
Arabia boasted a wide variety of Semitic languages in antiquity
 Previously, the earliest attestation of Old Arabic was thought to be a single 1st century CE inscription in Sabaic script at Qaryat al-Faw, in southern present-day Saudi Arabia
Arabic languages
Linguists generally believe that "Old Arabic" (a collection of related dialects that constitute the precursor of Arabic) first emerged around the 1st century CE
 Safaitic and Hismaic, previously considered ANA, should be considered Old Arabic due to the fact that they participate in the innovations common to all forms of Arabic

It was also thought that Old Arabic coexisted alongside—and then gradually displaced--epigraphic Ancient North Arabian (ANA), which was theorized to have been the regional tongue for many centuries
There are several features which Classical Arabic, the modern Arabic varieties, as well as the Safaitic and Hismaic inscriptions share which are unattested in any other Central Semitic language variety, including the Dadanitic and Taymanitic languages of the northern Hejaz


Classification
Arabic is usually classified as a Central Semitic language
 Thus, Arabic vernaculars do not descend from Classical Arabic: Classical Arabic is a sister language rather than their direct ancestor
 The last two share important isoglosses with later forms of Arabic, leading scholars to theorize that Safaitic and Hismaic are in fact early forms of Arabic and that they should be considered Old Arabic
 Innovations of the Central Semitic languages—all maintained in Arabic—include:

The conversion of the suffix-conjugated stative formation (jalas-) into a past tense
The earliest attestation of continuous Arabic text in an ancestor of the modern Arabic script are three lines of poetry by a man named Garm(')allāhe found in En Avdat, Israel, and dated to around 125 CE
Since the 7th century, Arabic has been characterized by diglossia, with an opposition between a standard prestige language—i
 Besides the Arabic alphabet, dialects are also often written in Latin from left to right or in Hebrew characters (in Israel) with no standardized orthography
 Arabic vernaculars do not descend from MSA or Classical Arabic
 The International Organization for Standardization assigns language codes to 33 varieties of Arabic, including MSA
 The following features can be reconstructed with confidence for Proto-Arabic:
negative particles m * /mā/; lʾn */lā-ʾan/ to Classical Arabic lan
mafʿūl G-passive participle
prepositions and adverbs f, ʿn, ʿnd, ḥt, ʿkdy
a subjunctive in -a
t-demonstratives
leveling of the -at allomorph of the feminine ending
ʾn complementizer and subordinator
the use of f- to introduce modal clauses
independent object pronoun in (ʾ)y
vestiges of nunationOn the other hand, several Arabic varieties are closer to other Semitic languages and maintain features not found in Classical Arabic, indicating that these varieties cannot have developed from Classical Arabic
 However, this inscription does not participate in several of the key innovations of the Arabic language group, such as the conversion of Semitic mimation to nunation in the singular
 These features are evidence of common descent from a hypothetical ancestor, Proto-Arabic
 ANA, despite its name, was considered a very distinct language, and mutually unintelligible, from "Arabic"
Arabic (اَلْعَرَبِيَّةُ, al-ʿarabiyyah [al ʕaraˈbijːa] (listen); عَرَبِيّ, ʿarabīy [ˈʕarabiː] (listen) or [ʕaraˈbij]) is a Semitic language spoken primarily across the Arab world
Arabic is traditionally written with the Arabic alphabet, a right-to-left abjad
 Ōkuma proposed that coins, which were previously square, be made into circles, and that the names of the traditional currencies, ryō (両), bu (分) and shu (朱), be unified into yen (円), which was accepted by the government
 dollar at the rate of $1 = 120 B yen
26 g) of fine silver, the yen was also defined as 1


Yen and major currencies float
By 1971, the yen had become undervalued
 The yen had appreciated to a peak of ¥271 per US$ in 1973, then underwent periods of depreciation and appreciation due to the 1973 oil crisis, arriving at a value of ¥227 per US$ by 1980


Yen adoption in Okinawa
After World War II the United States-administered Okinawa issued a higher-valued currency called the B yen from 1946 to 1958, which was then replaced by the U

Since 1973, the Japanese government has maintained a policy of currency intervention, so the yen is under a "dirty float" regime
 The belief that the yen, and several other major currencies, were undervalued motivated the United States' actions in 1971


Pronunciation and etymology
Yen derives from the Japanese word 圓 (えん, en, [eɴ]; "round"), which borrows its phonetic reading from Chinese yuan, similar to North Korean won and South Korean won
 That was the first full-scale Japanese-English/English-Japanese dictionary, which had a strong influence on Westerners in Japan and probably prompted the spelling "yen"

The yen replaced the complex monetary system of the Edo period in the form of Tokugawa coinage as well as the various hansatsu paper currencies issued by Japan's feudal fiefs in an array of incompatible denominations
 dollar
No true exchange rate existed for the yen between December 7, 1941, and April 25, 1949; wartime inflation reduced the yen to a fraction of its prewar value
 Since that time, however, the world price of the yen has greatly decreased
 occupation government fixed the value of the yen at ¥360 per US$ through a United States plan, which was part of the Bretton Woods system, to stabilize prices in the Japanese economy

The spelling and pronunciation "yen" is standard in English because when Japan was first encountered by Europeans around the 16th century, Japanese /e/ (え) and /we/ (ゑ) both had been pronounced [je] and Portuguese missionaries had spelled them "ye"
 Hepburn revised most "ye"s to "e" in the 3rd edition (1886) to mirror the contemporary pronunciation, except "yen"


Following the silver devaluation of 1873, the yen devalued against the US and Canadian dollars (since those two countries adhered to a gold standard), and by 1897, the yen was worth only about US$0
 When that system was abandoned in 1971, the yen became undervalued and was allowed to float


Fixed value of the yen to the U
 To stabilize the Japanese economy, the exchange rate of the yen was fixed at ¥360 per US$ as part of the Bretton Woods system
 In that year, Japan adopted a gold exchange standard, defining the yen as 0
 This exchange rate remained in place until Japan left the gold standard in December 1931, after which the yen fell to $0
 The yen replaced the previous Tokugawa coinage as well as the various hansatsu paper currencies issued by feudal han (fiefs)
On June 27, 1871, the Meiji government officially adopted the "yen" as Japan's modern unit of currency under the New Currency Act of 1871
 The Act also stipulated the adoption of the decimal accounting system of yen (1, 圓), sen (1⁄100, 錢), and rin (1⁄1000, 厘), with the coins being round and manufactured using Western machinery acquired from Hong Kong

The New Currency Act of 1871 introduced Japan's modern currency system, with the yen defined as 1
The yen (Japanese: 円, symbol: ¥; code: JPY) is the official currency of Japan
Following World War II, the yen lost much of its prewar value
 The Japanese government focused on a competitive export market, and tried to ensure a low exchange rate for the yen through a trade surplus
 Since 1946, the spelling "yen" is depicted on Japanese banknotes

 Switzerland's precursors established a defensive alliance in 1291, forming a loose confederation that persisted for centuries
 The treaty allowed Switzerland to increase its territory, with the admission of the cantons of Valais, Neuchâtel and Geneva
 The data code for Switzerland, CH, is derived from Latin Confoederatio Helveticacode: lat promoted to code: la  (English: Helvetic Confederation)
 An invading foreign army had imposed and destroyed centuries of tradition, making Switzerland nothing more than a French satellite state
Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a landlocked country located at the confluence of Western, Central and Southern Europe
 Modern-day Switzerland was then divided between the kingdoms of Alemannia and Burgundy
 This identity transcends language, ethnicity, and religion, leading to Switzerland being described as a Willensnationcode: deu promoted to code: de  ("nation of volition") rather than a nation state
 Switzerland's borders saw only minor adjustments thereafter
 The territories of present-day Switzerland became divided into Middle Francia and East Francia until they were reunified under the Holy Roman Empire around 1000 AD

Switzerland is one of the world's most developed countries
In the Early Middle Ages, from the end of the fourth century, the western extent of modern-day Switzerland was part of the territory of the Kings of the Burgundians
 It was not until more than one hundred years after these internal wars that, in 1648, under the Peace of Westphalia, European countries recognised Switzerland's independence from the Holy Roman Empire and its neutrality
Around 260 AD, the fall of the Agri Decumates territory north of the Rhine transformed today's Switzerland into a frontier land of the Empire
The krone (alternatively crown; German: Krone, Hungarian: korona, Italian: Corona, Polish: korona, Slovene: krona, Serbo-Croatian: kruna, Czech: koruna, Slovak: koruna, Romanian: coroană) was the official currency of Austria-Hungary from 1892 (when it replaced the gulden as part of the adoption of the gold standard) until the dissolution of the empire in 1918

 The record represents the first document of Croatian realms, vassal states of Francia at the time
 In the mid-18th century, the first attempts to provide a Croatian literary standard began on the basis of the Neo-Shtokavian dialect that served as a supraregional lingua franca pushing back regional Chakavian, Kajkavian, and Shtokavian vernaculars
 Conversely, the Iranian theory proposes Iranian origin, based on Tanais Tablets containing Ancient Greek inscriptions of given names Χορούαθος, Χοροάθος, and Χορόαθος (Khoroúathos, Khoroáthos, and Khoróathos) and their interpretation as anthroponyms of Croatian people
The Croats () Croatian: Hrvati [xr̩ʋǎːti]) are a South Slavic ethnic group who share a common Croatian ancestry, culture, history and language
 Croatian is written in Gaj's Latin alphabet
Croatia ( (listen), kroh-AY-shə; Croatian: Hrvatska, pronounced [xř̩ʋaːtskaː]), officially the Republic of Croatia (Croatian: Republika Hrvatska, (listen)), is a country at the crossroads of Central and Southeast Europe
 In the south, while having periods of independence, the Naretines merged with Croats later under control of Croatian Kings
Croatian ( (listen); hrvatski [xř̩ʋaːtskiː]) is the standardized variety of the Serbo-Croatian pluricentric language used by Croats, principally in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Serbian province of Vojvodina, and other neighboring countries
Croatian villages
 A closer reading of the DAI suggests that Constantine VII's consideration about the ethnic origin and identity of the population of Lower Pannonia, Pagania, Zachlumia and other principalities is based on tenth century political rule and does not indicate ethnicity, and although both Croats and Serbs could have been a small military elite which managed to organize other already settled and more numerous Slavs, it is possible that Narentines, Zachlumians and others also arrived as Croats or with Croatian tribal alliance
 These dialects, and the four national standards, are usually subsumed under the term "Serbo-Croatian" in English, though this term is controversial for native speakers, and paraphrases such as "Bosnian-Croatian-Montenegrin-Serbian" are therefore sometimes used instead, especially in diplomatic circles
Scholars have hypothesized the name Croat (Hrvat) may be Iranian, thus suggesting that the Croatians were possibly a Sarmatian tribe from the Pontic region who were part of a larger movement at the same time that the Slavs were moving toward the Adriatic
 The oldest preserved record of the Croatian ethnonym *xъrvatъ is of the variable stem, attested in the Baška tablet in style zvъnъmirъ kralъ xrъvatъskъ ("Zvonimir, Croatian king"), although it was archaeologically confirmed that the ethnonym Croatorum is mentioned in a church inscription found in Bijaći near Trogir dated to the end of the 8th or early 9th century
 In 1527, faced with Ottoman conquest, the Croatian Parliament elected Ferdinand I of Austria to the Croatian throne
Besides the Shtokavian dialect, on which Standard Croatian is based, there are two other main dialects spoken on the territory of Croatia, Chakavian and Kajkavian
 The decisive role was played by Croatian Vukovians, who cemented the usage of Ijekavian Neo-Shtokavian as the literary standard in the late 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, in addition to designing a phonological orthography

Standard Croatian is based on the most widespread dialect of Serbo-Croatian, Shtokavian, more specifically on Eastern Herzegovinian, which is also the basis of Standard Serbian, Bosnian, and Montenegrin
 Croatian is a recognised minority language within Croatian autochthonous communities and minorities in Montenegro, Austria (Burgenland), Italy (Molise), Romania (Carașova, Lupac) and Serbia (Vojvodina)
 Croatian is also one of the official languages of Bosnia and Herzegovina and a recognized minority language in Serbia and neighboring countries
 The Croatian language is official in Croatia, the European Union and Bosnia and Herzegovina
 The native Croatian royal dynasty was founded by duke Trpimir I in the mid 9th century, who defeated the Byzantine and Bulgarian forces
 Since 2000, the Croatian government has invested in infrastructure, especially transport routes and facilities along the Pan-European corridors
 The first native Croatian ruler recognised by the Pope was duke Branimir, who received papal recognition from Pope John VIII on 7 June 879
 Whilst there is possible evidence of population continuity between Gothic and Croatian times in parts of Dalmatia, the idea of a Gothic origin of Croats was more rooted in 20th century Ustaše political aspirations than historical reality
 The ethnic Tarara people, indigenous to Te Tai Tokerau in New Zealand, are of mixed Croatian and Māori (predominately Ngāpuhi) descent


History
Antiquity
Human habitation in Qatar dates back to 50,000 years ago
 The 2022 FIFA World Cup was awarded to Qatar under controversial circumstances,  making it the first Arab country and the first in the Middle East to host the event
 Qatar played a role in the commercial activity of the Sasanids, contributing at least two commodities: precious pearls and purple dye

Kassite Babylonian material dating back to the second millennium BC found in Al Khor Islands attests to trade relations between the inhabitants of Qatar and the Kassites in modern-day Bahrain
 Qatar's human rights record has been regarded by academics and non-governmental organisations as being generally poor, with restrictions on civil liberties such as the freedoms of association, expression and the press, as well as its treatment of thousands of migrant workers amounting to forced labour for projects in the country
 The Gulf of Bahrain, an inlet of the Persian Gulf, separates Qatar from nearby Bahrain
 During the latter part of the Christian era, Qatar comprised a region known as 'Beth Qatraye' (Syriac for "house of the Qataris")

After the eventual fall of the Mauryans, the Indo-Greek Kingdom took its place in the Western Punjab, however the Eastern Punjab supposedly wouldn't become subdued till the rule of Menander I, however there is little evidence of any battles with the republics till after his death
 Joshi: "There is no doubt that the Kambojas, Daradas, Kaikayas, Andhra, Pauravas, Yaudheyas, Malavas, Saindhavas, and Kurus had jointly contributed to the heroic tradition and composite culture of ancient Punjab
 The rise of kingdoms and dynasties in the Punjab is chronicled in the ancient Hindu epics, particularly the Mahabharata
 With the help of the small Janapadas of Punjab, he had gone on to conquer much of the North West Indian subcontinent
 Agriculture has been the major economic feature of the Punjab and has therefore formed the foundation of Punjabi culture, with one's social status being determined by land ownership
 However, Eudemus, who had served as Alexander's satrap in the Punjab region, treacherously killed Porus
 The Punjab emerged as an important agricultural region, especially following the Green Revolution during the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, and has been described as the "breadbasket of both India and Pakistan
 The Gandharas, Kambojas, Trigartas, Andhra, Pauravas, Bahlikas (Bactrian settlers of the Punjab), Yaudheyas, and others sided with the Kauravas in the great battle fought at Kurukshetra
 Punjabi Muslims are the majority in West Punjab (Pakistan), while Punjabi Sikhs  are the majority in East Punjab (India)

Punjab grew out of the settlements along the five rivers, which served as an important route to the Near East as early as the ancient Indus Valley civilization, dating back to 3000 BCE, and had numerous migrations by the Indo-Aryan peoples
Punjab (; Gurmukhi: ਪੰਜਾਬ; Shahmukhi: پنجاب; Punjabi: [pənˈdʒaːb] (listen); also romanised as Panjāb or Panj-Āb) is a geopolitical, cultural, and historical region in South Asia, specifically in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, comprising areas of eastern Pakistan and northwestern India
Around two centuries after defeating the Indo-greeks, the Kushans under Kanishka conquered Punjab
 As Alexander never crossed the Beas river, so his territory probably lied in Punjab region

The predominant ethnolinguistic group of the Punjab region are the Punjabi people, who speak the Indo-Aryan Punjabi language
 Thus causing the start the Kushan downfall and resulting in a century of peace in Punjab before the Gupta expansion which saw the eventual disappearance of the republics
 In the 16th century Mughal Empire the Punjab was split into the Lahore Subah which consisted of Punjab up to Jallandhar with jammu in its boundaries and the Delhi subah which comprised the area east of Jallandhar up to western UP(visit: Subah)
The boundaries of the region are ill-defined and focus on historical accounts and thus the geographical definition of the term "Punjab" has changed over time
 The core of the Mauryan army and Chandraguptas inital military when battling the Nandas, was made of up men from the Punjab Janapadas according to Thomas William Rhys Davids
 The epic battles described in the Mahabharata are chronicled as being fought in what is now the state of Haryana and historic Punjab
 In the early 3rd century BC a union formed between the Punjab republics to expel the Kushans, resulting in a Kushan defeat and being pushed out of Eastern Punjab as stated by the famous historian Anant Sadashiv Altekar
"The Punjab is also accredited for the establishment of many major dynasties and empires, for example the Hindu Shahis, accredited for the defeat of the Saffarid dynasty and the Samanid Empire
 The Mauryan military was also made up vastly of men from the Punjab Janapadas


Etymology
Although the name Punjab is of Persian origin, its two parts (پنج, panj, 'five' and آب, āb, 'water') are cognates of the Sanskrit words, पञ्‍च, pañca, 'five' and अप्, áp, 'water', of the same meaning
 He has also been variously identified with Shashigupta (who has same etymology as of Chandragupta) of Paropamisadae (western Punjab) on the account of same life events


Eastern Punjab republics (4th BCE - 4th CE)
The Eastern Punjab republics also known as the Punjab Janapadas were a group of kingdoms during the ancient period of Punjab that were extremely militaristic and formed after the Aryan migrations into the region
 The Punjab is also responsible for the Tughlaq and Sayyid empires which formed two of the Delhi sultanate dynasties
 The Eastern Punjab republics in Ancient Punjab (Yaudheya, Trigarta, Arjunayanas, Audumbaras) are also accredited for the establishment of the Mauryan empire and the defeat of many foreign forces that entered Punjab, for example the Indo-Greek Kingdom and the Kushan Empire
 In British India, until the Partition of India in 1947, the Punjab Province encompassed the present-day Indian states and union territories of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Chandigarh, and Delhi, and the Pakistani regions of Punjab, and Islamabad Capital Territory

History
Prehistory
There is evidence of continuous human habitation in present-day Thailand from 20,000 years ago to the present day

History
Early and medieval age
Some of the earliest ancient human civilisations in South Asia originated from areas encompassing present-day Pakistan

Under the British, modern Pakistan was mostly divided into the Sind Division, Punjab Province, and the Baluchistan Agency

Pakistan is the site of several ancient cultures, including the 8,500-year-old Neolithic site of Mehrgarh in Balochistan, the Indus Valley civilisation of the Bronze Age, the most extensive of the civilisations of the Afro-Eurasia, and the ancient Gandhara civilization
 As the United Kingdom agreed to the partitioning of India in 1947, the modern state of Pakistan was established on 14 August 1947 (27th of Ramadan in 1366 of the Islamic Calendar), amalgamating the Muslim-majority eastern and northwestern regions of British India
 The region that comprises the modern state of Pakistan was the realm of multiple empires and dynasties, including the Achaemenid; briefly that of Alexander the Great; the Seleucid, the Maurya, the Kushan, the Gupta; the Umayyad Caliphate in its southern regions, the Hindu Shahis, the Ghaznavids, the Delhi Sultanate, the Mughals, the Durranis, the Omani Empire, the Sikh Empire, British East India Company rule, and most recently, the British Indian Empire from 1858 to 1947
